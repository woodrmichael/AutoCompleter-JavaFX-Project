# CSC1120 Labs 8, 11, 13, and 14

Each week you will be required to complete multiple commits that build towards
a complete lab solution for each week. The focus of lab 8 is to develop
rigorous tests to validate that the implementation of an interface is correct.
You will revisit this project in furture lab assignments.
